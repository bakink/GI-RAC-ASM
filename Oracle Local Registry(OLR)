ORACLE LOCAL REGISTRY(OLR) contains node-specific information required by OHASD . Every node has its own dedicated OLR file.(not shared between the nodes).

As OCRs files are present in ASM diskgroup, While starting the CRS, it wont be able to Access OCR file to find the cluster resource information. Because at this point ASM instance would also be down. So at this point OLR file ( which is present at normal file system) is accessed to start the required resources.

 

1. The default location of OLR:

1
2
3
4
 
 
$GRID_HOME/cdata/*olr
 
2.View the available backups of OLR:

1

$GRID_HOME/bin/ocrconfig -local -showbackup
 
prod60-2     2017/02/06 13:10:06     /crsapp/app/oracle/product/grid12c/cdata/prod60-2/backup_20170206_131006.olr     0
 
2. Take the backup of OLR manually: ( Need to done from ROOT user)

Verifying OLR integrity
 
Checking OLR integrity...
Check of existence of OLR configuration file "/var/opt/oracle/olr.loc" passed
Check of attributes of OLR configuration file "/var/opt/oracle/olr.loc" passed
 
WARNING:
This check does not verify the integrity of the OLR contents. Execute 'ocrcheck -local' as a privileged user to verify the contents of OLR.
 
OLR integrity check passed
 
Verification of OLR integrity was successful.
 
4. Check the current OLR location:

5. View OLR in text format:

$GRID_HOME/bin/ocrdump -local -stdout
 
6. Restore OLR from backup:

In case OLR is corrupted, Restore it from backup.
